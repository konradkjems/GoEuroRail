2. Restaurant recommendations for each city with specific venue names (breakfast, lunch, dinner)
3. Cultural tips and local customs to be aware of

IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:
- Create fully detailed itineraries for ALL cities, not just the first few
- Every city should have a complete day-by-day plan with similar level of detail
- Include specific timing suggestions for activities (e.g., "9:00 AM: Visit...")
- Name actual venues, restaurants, and attractions - avoid generic suggestions
- For longer stays (3+ nights), cover different aspects of the city on different days
- Format the itinerary as a professional travel document with clear sections for each day and city
- Use markdown formatting with headings, bullet points, and emphasis where appropriate

Remember that travelers need specific, actionable information they can follow for their entire trip.
